= Details =
The phone widgets must be configured through the config-page. You choose your phone system with a dropdown. Phone systems from Auerswald (such as VoiP 5010, VoiP 5020 or Commander Basic.2) need a user and a password. Best practice is to create a new user in the phone system and use these. The fritz!box (such as fritz!box 7050) use only a password, user can be left empty. The 'offline' phone system ist only for demo and creates random values.

If you wan't to extend smartVISU to your phone system, place you have to create a new file in 'lib/phone/service' named as your phone system. Show at the files located there, to see how it will work.
