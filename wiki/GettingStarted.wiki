#Getting started with your visualisation

= Introduction =

To create your own visualisation with smartVISU it is important to understand the structure of smartVISU. This is explained in the [GettingStartet#Basics] section.


= Basics =

== The pages folder ==

This folder holds all available visualisations that come with smartVISU

{{{
Folder structure:
 - pages
   - _template  (templates for quick start)
   - apps       (all apps that are available)
   - base       (holds the base HTML files)
   - docu       (A docu as a visualisation)
   - gleiss     (Demo visualaisation)
}}}

The visualisations _docu_ and _gleiss_ can be activated in the configuration of samrtVISU.

For a quick start you can copy the _template_ folder and rename it to your visualisation name.

Every visualisation can be build by the HTML files in its folder. If a needed basic HTML file ([GettingStartet#The_basic_HTML_files]) is not in the folder of you visualisation, smartVISU loads it from the _base_ folder.

== The basic HTML files ==

=== index.html ===
This file represents the first site that is displayed if you access your visualisation via a browser. It is splited in two parts that devide the screen in a left and right section.
