== Driver: smarthome.py == 

If you are going to use this driver all items should be divided with a '.' point. They have to be in the structure defined in your smarthome.py config like:
{{{
floor.room.light.value
}}}

Set the address (in the config) to the server-ip (or dns). Do not use 'localhost', because the ip has to be reached from the client.
The standard-port is 2424.
