= What is new in release v2.2? =

This release is for all that have '<a href="http://mknx.github.com/smarthome/">smarthome.py</a>' or '<a href="http://www.domotiga.nl/">DomotiGa</a>'.
Both work with a websockets for realtime communication without any delays. Mention that not all browsers support websockets!

Beside that we have made many improvements:
- New model-homes
- New design: 'Greenhornet'
- New phone-service: fritz!box 5.5
- New event and notification center


== Driver: smarthome.py == 

If you are going to use this driver all items should be divided with a '.' point. They have to be in the structure defined in your smarthome.py config like:
{{{
floor.room.light.value
}}}

Set the address (in the config) to the server-ip (or dns). Do not use 'localhost', because the ip has to be reached from the client.
The standard-port is 2424.
