; To add your custom settings:
; 1. copy this file to e.g custom.ini
; 2. set the base language in 'extends' (e.g. extends = "en" or extends = "de-ch")
; 3. Add only formats which should be overridden or added (don't forget to add the categories in [])
; 4. Change your language setting in configuration to 'custom'
; custom.ini may be placed in ./dropins/lang as per smartVISU v3.2 in order to protect it against version upgrades.

extends = "en"
