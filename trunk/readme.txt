DISCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
smartVISU is a framework to create a visualisation for a knx-installation with
simple html-pages. To read and write group-telegramms special tags are used.
You don't need to know javascript.


SYSTEMREQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    -   KNX-Bus
    -   eibd
	-	linknx or smarthome.py
    -   Webserver with PHP 5.2.4 
    -   Firefox, Chrome, IE, Safari, iPhone, iPad, Android Phone or Android 
        Tablet
 
 
10 STEP GUIDE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For your own Project do the following:
    
    1.  Create a new directory in "pages", for example "pages/visu" or 
        "pages/YOURPROJECT". This is your individual project-directory where you
		may work. Copy all files from "pages/_template" to your project-directory
    
    2.  Check the config.php and set the "config_pages" to "YOURPROJECT"
      
    3.  Set the "config_driver" to your backend-environment
        - linknx: for linxknx and eibd environment
		- smarthome.py for smarthome environment
		- eibd for direct access
        - offline: only for testing, all GADs will be stored in a textfile 
          ("temp/offline_YOURPROJECT.var")
        
    4.  Create a new page in your project-directory, for example "mypage.html"
        Note: Do not use "base.html, basic.html, device.html", these are system
        pages
    
    5.  Fill the page with your preferred content and widgets
    
    6.  If you need to change the design, use a "visu.css" - stylesheet file in 
        your project-directory. 
		If you wand to develop own widgets, also place them in your directory.
		Name a the javascript-file (if you need on) to "visu.js" and it will be
		included automatically. Name the file with the widgets e. g. "custom.html"
    
    7.  Change your design (theme) with:
        http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/
        
        Drop your new design (theme) in the "designs" directory
        Set "config_design" to your new design-name (without .css), mention that
        "NAME.min.css" is been loaded
     
    8.  Test your page with:
        http://localhost/smartVISU/index.php?page=mypage
        Note: replace "localhost" with your hostname from your server      
   
    9.  Create all pages you need
     
   10.  At the end of your project set "config_cache" to "true" to speed up your
        smartVISU
        
        Enjoy smartVISU!
