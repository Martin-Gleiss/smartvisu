## How it works

This tool should help you to create widgets for your smartvisu-Web-Interface.
It will assist you with autocompletes for widgets, items, icons, and colors.
After you have selected a widget (like basic.symbol...) you will get a tooltip for this kind of widget. The acutal parameter is highlighted in red and all the available details will be shown in the tooltip-window.
For icons and colors you will see a preview in the tooltip-window.
After completing the wiget you can render it in a new window. The widget in the rendered window is fully working, except there is an error in the created widget, you will get a TWIG-Error.
The final widget including the brackets "{{" + "}}" will be stored on rendering to the clipboard.
You can paste the widget-code directly to you html-file.

## Known Issues

It is possible to render the new widget into the iframe on the actual page.
But this will destroy the loaded index.php. You will get in trouble when you want
to use the navigation of smartvisu again.
No solution right now.  You can reload the page with bypassing the cache,
then everthing is working again. (STRG+F5 / CTRL + Shift + R)
