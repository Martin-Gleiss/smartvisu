* This file activates the design 'darkblue.css' by default and switches to 'lightblue.css' if the device is not in dark mode.
* You can build your own pair of dark/light mode designs by changing the file names to the desired designs.
* It is recommended to place the file - e.g. 'mydarkmode.css' - in ./dropins/designs. Then, the folder structure has to be considered 
* in the @import statements, e.g. @import '../../designs/greenhornet.css', (prefers-color-scheme: dark);
